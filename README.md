# racecar_localizer
This is the racecar localizer software. Right now just a script that filters out everything except green colours. 

To run install python and opencv. 

TO DO:

- Blob detection to detect circle 
- tryout the system using webcam and racecar with green circle on top
- design and implement a reference point on the track for automatic calibration
- Create a setup where the whole track is visible on camera and car can be tracked everywhere
